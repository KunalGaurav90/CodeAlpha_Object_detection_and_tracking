# CodeAlpha_Object_detection_and_tracking
A complete workflow for building a real-time object detection and tracking system. This process starts by capturing a video feed with a library like OpenCV, then uses a pre-trained model like the fast YOLO(8) or the more accurate Faster R-CNN to identify and draw bounding boxes around objects in each frame.(
